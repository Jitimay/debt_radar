# 🛡️ G-FIN - Global Financial Immunity Network

AI-powered financial crisis prediction system that acts as an "immune system" for the global economy, predicting financial crises 6-12 months in advance.

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Financial Immunity Score**: 0-100 scale (80-100: Stable, 50-79: Fragile, 0-49: High Risk)
- **Crisis Prediction**: ML model predicting defaults 6-12 months ahead
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Automated SMS/email/API alerts for decision makers
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time risk visualization with Streamlit
- **Explainable AI**: Feature importance and risk factor analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd dcews

# Generate real data and train model
python3 generate_data.py
python3 train_model.py

# Launch G-FIN dashboard
streamlit run app.py

# Run CLI demo
python3 demo.py
```

## 📊 Current Results (2022 Predictions)

```
🔴 HIGH RISK:  Sri Lanka (0.0), Ghana (0.0), Zambia (0.0)
🟡 FRAGILE:    [Countries with scores 50-79]
🟢 STABLE:     Kenya (85.2), South Africa (82.1)
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python, scikit-learn (GradientBoosting)

## 🚨 Alert System

G-FIN automatically triggers alerts when:
- **Immunity Score < 50**: 🚨 HIGH RISK - Immediate intervention required
- **Immunity Score 50-79**: ⚠️ FRAGILE - Monitor closely
- **Immunity Score ≥ 80**: ✅ STABLE - Low risk

## 🌍 Real Data Integration

G-FIN uses real financial data from:
- **Sri Lanka**: 2010-2022 (including 2022 crisis)
